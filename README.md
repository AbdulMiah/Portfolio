# Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository! This project showcases my journey, skills, and projects in an immersive and interactive way. The portfolio is built using React with TypeScript, powered by Vite for fast development. It incorporates Three.js for stunning 3D rendering and Tailwind CSS for sleek styling.

## Features

- 🧩 Built with React and TypeScript, accelerated by Vite

## CI/CD Workflow and Automated Deployment

I've implemented a robust CI/CD workflow to ensure seamless updates and deployment. Leveraging Docker 🐳, AWS EC2 ☁️, and GitHub Actions 🚀, the process is automated. Here's how it works:

1. **Push to GitHub:** Any code pushed to the main branch triggers the CI/CD pipeline.
2. **GitHub Actions:** GitHub Actions initiates the workflow, building the Docker image.
3. **Docker Image Creation:** A Docker image is created to encapsulate the application.
4. **Deployment to AWS EC2:** The Docker image is deployed to an AWS EC2 instance, ensuring the latest version is live.
5. **Live Website Update:** Updates to the portfolio are swiftly reflected on the live website.
